## Project Overview
This project involves the development and evaluation of a digit recognition system. A custom CNN was implemented and trained on the MNIST dataset using optimizers such as Adam and RMSprop. Regularization techniques, including dropout, were applied to improve the modelâ€™s generalization ability. Additionally, pre-trained models like LeNet-5, ResNet-like, and VGG16 were evaluated to enhance performance, with VGG16 achieving the highest accuracy.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset was used for training and testing the model. It contains:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 examples (split into 50,000 for training and 10,000 for validation).
- **Testing Set**: 10,000 examples.

Each image is 28x28 pixels and represented by grayscale values ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 is black, 255 is white, and intermediate values represent shades of gray.

## Model Architecture
### Custom CNN
- A custom 8-layer CNN was designed for digit recognition.
- Regularization techniques (L1, L2, and dropout) were used to enhance generalization.
- Models were trained using Adam and RMSprop optimizers, achieving high accuracy.

### Pre-Trained Models
1. **LeNet-5**: A lightweight CNN model, efficient for digit recognition tasks.
2. **ResNet-like**: A scaled-down ResNet with residual connections to address vanishing gradient issues.
3. **VGG16**: A deeper architecture with 16 layers, offering higher accuracy at the cost of computational complexity.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib (install via `requirements.txt`).

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naidu-2002/Digit-Recognition.git
   cd Digit-Recognition

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Install all the required Python libraries using `pip`:  

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results

The digit recognition system achieved excellent performance through both custom CNN and pre-trained models.

### Custom CNN
- **Adam Optimizer**: Achieved 97% test accuracy with minimal loss.
- **RMSprop Optimizer**: Slightly higher accuracy of 97.9% but with higher validation loss.

### Pre-Trained Models
The performance of pre-trained models was evaluated using Adam and RMSprop optimizers:

| Model       | Optimizer | Test Accuracy | Test Loss |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| LeNet-5     | Adam      | 97.9%         | 0.07      |
| ResNet-like | RMSprop   | 99.48%        | 0.02      |
| VGG16       | Adam      | 99.5%         | 0.022     |

### Regularization Methods (Custom CNN)
The impact of regularization techniques was analyzed:

| Method     | Test Accuracy | Test Loss |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| L1         | 96.9%         | 0.75      |
| L2         | 95.0%         | 0.32      |
| Dropout    | 97.54%        | 0.14      |

### Visualizations
- **Accuracy and Loss Curves**: Accuracy and loss trends during training for both Adam and RMSprop optimizers are stored in the `results/` directory.
- **Predicted Outputs**: Example digit classifications are saved as images in the `results/` directory.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for handwritten digit recognition, with VGG16 achieving the highest accuracy among the evaluated models.

## Future Work

The digit recognition system has shown promising results, but there are several areas for future improvements:
- **Model Enhancement**: Experiment with advanced architectures like transformers or attention-based models to improve accuracy.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Develop a web or mobile application for real-time digit recognition.
- **Extended Dataset**: Expand the dataset to include more complex and diverse digit samples (e.g., EMNIST or custom datasets).
- **Explainability**: Integrate model interpretability techniques like Grad-CAM to visualize the features influencing predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use automated tools like Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization to find the best hyperparameters.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Develop a lightweight model for deployment on edge devices like mobile phones or embedded systems.
